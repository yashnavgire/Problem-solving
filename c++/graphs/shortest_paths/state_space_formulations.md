### state space formulations in implicit graph problems

Every graph needs - 
1. nodes - which needs states
2. edges - directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted, if weighted then what will decide the weight

In shortest path problem 
- The parameter which needs to be minimised should be modelled to be represented as weights in edge (either as same weights or 0-1 weights or 0..n weights based on problem)

- The additional constraint in the problem is added to the state along with the base state.
