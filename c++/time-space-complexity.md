### Time complexity

Can be considered as rate of change of execution time of the algorithm as the input size increases
IF n = input size then dy/dx = time complexity [O(N)]


### Sapce complexity

Can be considered as rate of change of total space (auxilary + input) required to execute the algorithm
where,
auxilary : the extra space for ds used to solve the problem
input : space required to store input values

### Note 

Big O notation 
- TC of worst case scenario
- ignore constants & small values (when the input value is high these values are negligible when calculating rateof change)

Theta notation
- TC of best case scenario

Omega notation
- TC of average case scenario
